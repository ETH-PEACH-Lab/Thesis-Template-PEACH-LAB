The most important rule of Abstracts is that they describe the work, not the paper. 
Include, at most, one sentence of motivation. 
Save the rest of your motivation for the
Introduction. Effective Abstracts focus on two things: (1) Describing what was \emph{done}. (2) Describing what was \emph{found} (key results). 
Be specific about your key findings. 
Instead of \say{many} say \say{84\%}. 
Keep the Abstract to one paragraph and
fewer than 200 words.
