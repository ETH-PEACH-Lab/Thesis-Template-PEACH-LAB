\section{Discussion}
Whereas the Results section reported on what was \emph{found}, the Discussion section reports on what was \emph{interesting} and what \emph{matters}. 
Some questions to consider when writing your Discussion section: 
What are the implications of your results?
What do they mean for this topic and your field?
What is important and worthy of again being called to the readerâ€™s attention? 
What was surprising? unexpected? intriguing? 
Did you fulfill the promises you set out in the Introduction via the claims you made about your work? 
Were any hypotheses confirmed or disconfirmed? 
Were the predictions of any theory upheld or refuted? 
What worked and what did not work? 
(This is a chance to be honest and show that you are objective with respect to your own work.)

The Discussion is not usually divided into subsections, but it can be if it is long. 
One subsection sometimes included at the end of Discussion sections is Limitations. 
In a single paragraph, lay out what the evident limitations of your study were and caution against faulty interpretations or overgeneralization of your results.
